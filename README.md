# PhotoOrganizer
Personal project to organize photos from one directory into distinct directories grouped by year and month. Developed with nodejs.

## Installation
You can download the source code and run on the cmd:
```
npm install
```

## Usage

### Group by year

**Copy** the **path** to the photoOrganizer.js file. Go to the directory where there are your photos and open the cmd on the location. 
**Paste** the **path** to the photoOrganizer.js file and run the command `node <PASTE-HERE-THE-PATH>`.
The photos will be grouped by year in different directories

### Group by month

Inside a directory of photos, **paste** the path to the photoOrganizer.js file and write *yes* in the end of the line.

Example: `node <YOUR-PATH>\src\photoOrganizer.js yes`

The photos will be grouped by month in different directories.

## Future feature

There will be no need to copy and paste all the path to the file. It will be possible to install it globally with npm.
